# Vector Scan to Map Matching

This program contains (or will contain) a library which can match a point cloud with a vector-based map as well as some examples. The most notable application of this algorithm would be for mobile robot localization in cases where the map is well known.

Example results are made using gnuplot v5.4 and martinruenz's gnuplotcpp, a simple C++ interface for gnuplot.
